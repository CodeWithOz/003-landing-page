# Netflix User Dashboard

Live demo available
[here](http://003-landing-page-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com).

This is a recreation of the Netflix user dashboard built with React,
using React Hooks for state management, and styled using CSS modules.
It is my recreation of challenge 003 of the
[React Daily UI challenge](https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-daily-ui)
by Fullstack React.

## Developer Setup

Clone the repo and cd into the newly-created `003-landing-page` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/CodeWithOz/003-landing-page.git
cd 003-landing-page/
```

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Testing

Run `yarn test`.

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so all its
CLI options are available.
